## My name is Jamie Zhang

Hi there! My name is Jamie and I was graduated from [University of Wollongong](http://www.uow.edu.au) and now work as a freelance graphical designer. My personal goal is to convert my idea into reality and I would like to express my idea through graphical design.

## About this blog

I've posted (and will keep it updated too) lots of my design portfolio to this site. Come and have a look at my design!
