## Robot Competition logo (1)
<center>![MacDown logo](http://i847.photobucket.com/albums/ab31/yangxia/Hello%20Design%20Dreamer/IMG_0153_zpssar6aa0j.jpg)</center>

This is a team emblem (first draft) designed by a group participating in a robot competition. This team:

-  is comprised of young people;
-  comes from Wollongong, Illawara, New South Wales, Australia;
-  participated in the 2015 FIRST Robotics Competition by FIRST Robotics with the team number 5761.

### Design Concept
- The use of British style “shield and satin” combination to represent the team spirit of positivity and fortitude.
- The change of sword traditionally matched to the shield for “nail” and “wrench” is for the purpose of not only matching the theme of “robot”, but also highlighting the team spirit of readying to help others.
- Putting the face of a cartoon robot in the shield is to emphasise that the team is committed to participating in “robot” related activities. Since the team comes from Wollongong, the design of the hair of the robot comes from the symbol of Wollongong city (see the image below).：

- The letters “I”, “G”, “L” and “S” in the shield represent respectively the labels of the team: I – Illawara, G- Gamer, L – Learning and S – Science. If put the four letters upside down while keeping the direction of “G”, then the four letters can be seen as numbers 5761, which is the number of the team.

- **Overall style**:magnificence and innovation

## Robot Competition logo (2)
<center>![MacDown logo](http://i847.photobucket.com/albums/ab31/yangxia/Hello%20Design%20Dreamer/IMG_0155_zpshkvnuvvu.jpg)</center>

This is a team emblem (second draft) designed by a group participating in a robot competition.

The “Rebuild, Reload and Reuse” in the satin is the aim of the team, which matches the advocated “Recycle” at the robot competition they participate in.

### Design Concept
- The team requires the element of “tortoise” to be in the emblem, so another element “crown” is added to match the tortoise in order to show the pursuit of science. In this case, “tortoise” represents “perseverance” in traditional Chinese culture, and “crown” represents “power” and “status” in western culture. So the use of “crown” not only shows the nature of “competition” in this contest, but also promotes a spirit – perseverance in science will lead to success in the end.

- According to legend, in Europe in the Middle Ages, a young man named Blackmoor showed gallantry in a battle on a black wasteland. When David Quay, a British font designer, learned this history, he named one font he designed in 1983 as Blackmoor, in order to demonstrate the vigour in human spirit. So the “Rebuild, Reload and Reuse” in the Blackmoor font aims to demonstrate the perseverance of the team on the way to pursue science and when they are in difficulty.

- **Overall style**:perseverance and vigour

## Australian translation service provider 
<center>![MacDown logo](http://i847.photobucket.com/albums/ab31/yangxia/Hello%20Design%20Dreamer/IMG_0810_zpsqwf3gm81.jpg)</center>

This is a trademark designed for an Australian translation service provider and language training organisation. The characteristics of the company include:

- Chinese background
- NAATI translation service
- Chinese and IELTS training
- Named after “dragon”

### Design Concept
- Due to the cultural difference between China and the western world, dragon is “evil” in Australian’s eyes. But to Chinese people, dragon represents “luckiness”, “power” and “strength” in the 5000 year long history. In order to remove the evil side of “western dragon”, the trademark has undergone the following changes:

  - Removal of the sharp teeth and addition of short beard to make it more gentle;
  - Weakening of the claws to remove the element of fierceness;
  - Hollowing out the body of the dragon to show a sense of lightness;
  - Firm and persistent expression in the eye to show a Chinese spirit of toughness.

- **Overall style**:simple and lively
  - Black and white in colour to suit simple cultural background in Australia;
  - The design of the name of the organisation under the claw and semi-surrounded by the tail implies the idea of “catchall” in Chinese culture, and shows that this organisation is a master of Chinese and English languages in communication and can provide professional language services to clients based on this.

<center>![MacDown logo](http://i847.photobucket.com/albums/ab31/yangxia/Hello%20Design%20Dreamer/IMG_0318_zpsmb19drzt.jpg)</center>

This is a shop sign designed for a women’s dress shop.

- **Name of the shop**：Alice Shoppers Specialty Store
- **Style of the shop**：lovely and simple
- **Target customer group**：young women

### Design Concept
- To catch female buyers’ eyes and let customers know what is sold in this shop when they see the sign, in the design of “Alice” the letter “i” is changed to a profile of a lady with a hat and a long skirt, making the word “Alice” look more smart and catering for the female mentality to pursue a good-looking body.

- To satisfy the style of being lovely and simple for the shop and the target of attracting young women, the sign’s:
  - Overall style: simple, lovely, active  - Structure: in black and white, with modern-style silk banner satin under the name; “Alice” in the font of Blackmoor to show British simple style; “Shoppers specialty store” in yuppie font, showing the sense of loveliness and smart.

## Women’s dress shop
<center>![MacDown logo](http://i847.photobucket.com/albums/ab31/yangxia/Hello%20Design%20Dreamer/IMG_1228_zpshnqrmcin.jpg)</center>

This is a shop sign designed for a women’s dress shop.

- **Name of the shop**：Jian Pin- **Style of the shop**：simple- **Target customer group**：young mature women

### Design Concept
- Compared to the past, the young mature women in modern China have a different understanding of life and beauty. They get to know many western cultures, but still hold their love to traditional Chinese culture. Youth may be stepping away from them, but they are still longing for maturity. So these young mature women want to keep young but yearn for maturity at the same time. They possess the following labels:

> "<center> petty bourgeois; familiar with eastern and western trends in fashion; simple; temperament</center>"

- In order to attract mature women, the sign uses traditional Chinese inkpad as the basis of design. Both sides of the character in inverted colour show a sense of simplicity, clearness and neatness to avoid rigidness and paleness. The sign’s overall style is simple with a colour of dark red to attract those young mature women who pursue petty bourgeois but still want to keep their own temperament.
  - **Overall style**：simple, petty bourgeois, cultural sense, temperament
